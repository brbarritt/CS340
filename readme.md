First, the persistent connection to the database and how that was configured was derived from the Flask Starter repo (db_connector.py is almost unchanged). Additionally, most all App.routes are based on the Flask Starter repo and the instructions as outline in the Developing in Flask module -- although, we did make siginificant changes as we sought to alter our implementation and functionality. The templating and styling (as we chose to receive data as tuples) were built off our experience in web dev bootcamp and CS290. Lastly, several of the more complicated routes (e.g., location_info) were rooted in what we learned from the starter repo, but expanded on greatly by what we learned during Advanced SQL concepts. Lastly, we did not use any external libraries or imports beyond Bootstrap (as imported in base.j2)
